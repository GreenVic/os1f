* NOTE: This file now lists changes with newest at the top,
        starting with OSf7v01. This is not retroactive, so
        v1 to v17 are in the original order.
----------------------------------
OSf7v01
* NEW Platform - STM32F7-Discovery
* Added CMSIS library support
* Added HAL Support
* Started new git repo -- old history gone
* Bugs found/fixed
  - __HAL_LOCK deadlocks -- removed for now
  - spinlock get_lock can deadlock -- fixed
  - PSP not initialized on main task bootstrap -- fixed
* Features added
  - lcd_printf_at replaces term_printf_at
  - use stdatomic in some places
  - use scan mode for ADC task
**********************************
v1
* Initial version

v2
* Resolve potential issue with corrupting task stack
* Demonstrate task with parameters

v3
* Setup system init with full speed clock
* Add SysTick ISR and config with 1 MS period
* Enable full pre-emptability

v4
* Add sleep
* Add task states

v5
* add memory allocator
* use memory alloc to dynamically allocate threads
* concatenate task struct and stack into single memory region (per stack)

v6
* add locks to memory allocator (almost mutex)

v7
* add spinlocks and mutexs
* implement mem alloc locks with spinlocks

v8
* add support for semihosting (printf mostly)
  -- add __end__ to linker script,
     update cmd file,
     update linker options 
* vt100 support (just 'cause)
* broken in various ways

v9
* rewrote context switcher (again)
* main main function now converted to a task
* added to git repo  

v10
* significantly *simplified* operation
* main task now becomes task without mucking up main stack
* main task uses normal context switcher to bootstrap; no special case
* (maybe) fix mutex bug

v11
* fixes mutexes (probably)
* works with semi-hosting now (use make semi)

v12
* add ADC interface
* implement simple blocking read of internal temp sensor

V13
* add Vref reading to ADC task and print the ADC readings out

v14
* implement irq handler for ADC reading
* add event object to deal with irq handler
* found (didn't fix) bug related to calling functions from main
  -- for now, using the stack from main can corrupt the stack pointers
* add bitfield object for tracking waiting tasks in events and mutexes

v15
* implement adc init for simple cases

v16
* copy main stack to its own place and fix bigs related to MSP and PSP
getting out of sync

v17
* add USART
